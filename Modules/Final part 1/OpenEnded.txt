1) We need a loop to repeat the same instruction automatically. It is easier to write 1-100 with a loop than
writing 
console.log("1")
console.log("2")
console.log("3")

a loop can be written easily 

in JS we can use a for loop, 

for (let i = 1; i<=100; i++) {
console.log(i);

this code will output numbers 1 - 100.
Loops get the job done easier in automation.

2) console.log() displays and return outputs the values from a function.

console.log("the sum of 2+2 is")
sum(2,2) // Sum of 2+2

function sum(a,b) {
return a+b
}

output 
the sum of 2+2 is
4

3) They are boolean values, true or false. We can flag these values
let namanIsHome = true;

we can set this variable to be true when naman is home,
but set it false when Naman isn't home. We can use booleans
in conjunction with buttons to hide or display content and
change states and much more.

4) The Internet is a web of computers connected to each other, servers and clients, the server is requested by client to display content and the server then processes the request and displays the content.

5) A simple website is made up of html which is a markup language, the skeleton, then the clothes/design is made of CSS a styling sheet. A website itself has a URL (uniform resource locator) an address by which you access it through the Internet. A more functional website will make use of JS which is the logic. So using online calculators to calculate your tax, uses Javascript to process and evaluate fields of data.
